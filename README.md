# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Bachelor of Science majoring in Biological Science.  
- I am taking STATS 220 because I am considering doing a double major. 
- I am interested in learning about statistics and how it can be combined with biology.
